Known OMPi bugs/limitations
===========================

=> OpenMP V4.0 support: device constructs (target-related ones),
   cancellation constructs, taskgroup; runtime routines and environmental
   variables.
=> Most of OpenMP V3.1 is supported, except the new atomic
   construct; full support in the next version of OMPi.
=> Full C99 support except for variable-size arrays (they are
   only supported outside parallel regions). Of course, C99
   programs should also be supported by the system compiler.
=> For the moment, the parser cannot properly handle a variable 
   name if there exists a user-defined type with the same name.
=> The following do not work with the included process library (ee_process):
	 i) threadprivate variables ii) extern variables iii) tasks and 
	 iv) nested locks
