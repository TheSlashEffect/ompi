In order to create a new library named "mylib" you first need to create a
folder named ee_mylib in runtime. Copy there the files from this directory
and rename "ortconf.LibraryNameHere" to "ortconf.mylib"

Edit ortconf.mylib according to your library.

In the Makefile.am change "PUT LIBRARY NAME HERE" to "mylib", list all the
sources for your library in "PUT LIBRARY SOURCES HERE" and the headers in
PUT LIBRARY HEADERS HERE

In configure.in that's in the top directory, scroll down to the end and
put "runtime/ee_mylib/Makefile" in the AC_OUTPUT

OPTIONAL:
If your library needs to compiled with a different program than the one
used for compiling ompicc put a "Makelib.conf" in your library folder

If you want ompicc to create a Makefile along with the compiled program
for example when there is a special procedure involved when you need to
run your program, use "MakefileTemplate", and list it in "ompilib_DATA"
that's in Makefile.am. When you compile a program, ompicc will copy that
in the folder it was called from (unless if you call ompicc with
"--nomakefile") and then execute targets "compile" and "link" for compi-
ling and linking.
